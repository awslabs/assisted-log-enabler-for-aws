# Assisted Log Enabler for AWS - Find resources that are not logging, and turn them on.
Assisted Log Enabler for AWS is for customers who do not have logging turned on for various services, and lack knowledge of best practices and/or how to turn them on.

With Assisted Log Enabler for AWS, logging is turned on automatically for the various AWS Services for a customer:
* Amazon VPC Flow Logs (Single Account and Multi-Account using AWS Organizations)
* AWS CloudTrail (Single Account Only)
* Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) Audit and Authenticator Logs (Single Account and Multi-Account using AWS Organizations)
* Amazon Route 53 Resolver Query Logs (Single Account and Multi-Account using AWS Organizations)
* Amazon S3 Server Access Logs (Single Account and Multi-Account using AWS Organizations)
* NEW! Elastic Load Balancing Access Logs (Single Account and Multi-Account using AWS Organizations)

## Use Case
Logging information is important for troubleshooting issues and analyzing performance, and when Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers do not have logging turned on, the ability to assist them becomes limited, to the point that performing analysis may be impossible. In some cases, customers may not have the technical expertise needed to set up logging properly for the various AWS services.

Assisted Log Enabler for AWS is designed to ease the customer burden of learning how to turn on logs in the middle of a security incident. Assisted Log Enabler for AWS performs the work of creating an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket, checking the services to see if logging is turned on, and activating logging when it's found to be off.

When this work is performed, the customer can be assured that logging within their AWS environment is active to facilitate the investigation of future (and possibly ongoing) security incidents.

## Workflow Details
The following are the details of what happens within the Assisted Log Enabler for AWS workflow:
* An Amazon S3 bucket is created within the customer's account.
* A Lifecycle Policy is created for the bucket, with the following parameters:
   * Converts files to Intelligent-Tiering storage after 90 days
   * Deletes files after 365 days
* Block Public Access is explicitly set to On for the S3 bucket created.
* Amazon VPCs are checked to see if flow logs are turned on or off.
* For Amazon VPCs that do not have flow logs turned on, VPC Flow Logging is turned on, and sent to the bucket created.
   * Amazon VPC Flow Logs version 2, 3, 4, and 5 fields are all enabled.
* AWS CloudTrail service is checked to see there is at least one CloudTrail configured. (Single Account only as of this release)
* If no trail is configured, one is created and configured to log to the bucket created. (Single Account only as of this release)
* If Amazon EKS Clusters exist, audit & authenticator logs are turned on.
* Amazon Route 53 Query Logging is turned on for VPCs that do not have it turned on already.
* Amazon S3 Server Access Logs are created for buckets that do not have it turned on already.
   * This does not include for S3 buckets created by Assisted Log Enabler for AWS
   * Amazon S3 Server Access Logs require buckets that reside in the same account & region, so additional buckets for Amazon S3 Server Access logs are created for this.
 * NEW! Elastic Load Balancing Access Logs are created for Application, Network and Classic Load Balancers that do not have it turned on already.
   * Elastic Load Balancing Access Logs require buckets that reside in the region, so additional buckets for Elastic Load Balancing Access logs are created for this.
   * The following table contains the account IDs to use in place of elb-account-id in the bucket policy: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-access-logs.html

## Dry Run Mode
Dry Run modes for single and multi-account are both available. These modes allow you to check for resources in your environment that do not have logging turned on, but does not activate the logging for said resources.

To run Assisted Log Enabler for AWS in Dry Run mode, you can use the commands below:
```
# Single Account Dry Run
python3 assisted_log_enabler.py --mode dryrun --single_account
# Multi-Account Dry Run
python3 assisted_log_enabler.py --mode dryrun --multi_account
```

## Cleaning Up
Once the logs have been enabled, you can safely remove any of the downloaded files from AWS CloudShell.
* Note: The log file containing the detailed output of actions will be in the root directory of the Assisted Log Enabler for AWS tool. If you want to retain this, please download this to a safe place, either locally or to an Amazon S3 bucket, for your records. For information on how to download files from AWS CloudShell sessions, refer to the following [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/working-with-cloudshell.html#files-storage).

For any AWS IAM Roles that are created, either manually or using AWS CloudFormation StackSets, those can be safely deleted upon enablement of logs through the Assisted Log Enabler for AWS.

A cleanup mode is available within the Assisted Log Enabler for AWS (currently only for single account). Collected logs within Amazon S3 will NOT be removed, however, logging resources can be removed by following the below commands:
```
# To remove Amazon Route 53 Resolver Query Log resources created by Assisted Log Enabler for AWS (single account):
python3 assisted_log_enabler.py --mode cleanup --single_r53querylogs
# To remove Amazon VPC Flow Log resources created by Assisted Log Enabler for AWS (single account):
python3 assisted_log_enabler.py --mode cleanup --single_vpcflow
# To remove AWS CloudTrail trails created by Assisted Log Enabler for AWS (single account):
python3 assisted_log_enabler.py --mode cleanup --single_cloudtrail
# To remove Amazon S3 Server Access logging created by Assisted Log Enabler for AWS (single account):
python3 assisted_log_enabler.py --mode cleanup --single_s3logs
# NEW! To remove Elastic Load Balancing Access logging created by Assisted Log Enabler for AWS (single account):
python3 assisted_log_enabler.py --mode cleanup --single_lblogs
```

## Shared Responsibility Model
All resources created fall into the customer side of the Shared Responsibility Model.
